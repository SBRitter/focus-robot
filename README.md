# Experimental app for eliciting focus structures

This little web app belongs to the manuscript "The dynamics of intonation: categorical and continuous variation in an attractor-based model" by Simon Ritter, Doris MÃ¼cke and Martine Grice. The procedure in which it is used and the data recorded with this app are described in the paper. It is used to elicit utterances with controlled structure and varying focus types (background / early contrastive focus, broad focus, narrow focus, contrastive focus) by German native speakers in an interactive context. The task of the participant is to observe the action of one robot who maniupalates the location of an object and to give an information to another robot on how to retrieve this object. The structure of the question of the second robot elicits the focus structure of the sentence uttered as an answer by the participant.

Steps to set it up:

1. Clone the project

2. Change to the working directory

3. Make sure you have npm installed

4. Install the dependencies: npm install

5. Open index.html and load in a trial list from the subdirectory data-files, then start the experiment
